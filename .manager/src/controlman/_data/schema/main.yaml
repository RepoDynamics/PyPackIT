      The name has no restrictions on itself and can be any valid unicode string.
      However, to avoid confusion and make it easier for others to find and identify the project,
      it is recommended to **keep the project name as similar as possible to the
      [repository name](#ccc-repo-name), [distribution name](#ccc-pkg-name)
      and [import name](#ccc-pkg-import-name) of the package,
      and other project components**, which generally have stricter naming requirements.
      While these names can be separately set to custom values,
      it is recommended to allow the project name to be derived from the repository name (see default),
      and other names from the project name. 
      
      :::{admonition} Usage
      :class: dropdown note toggle-shown
      
      By default, `name` is used to derive names for project's distribution packages and artifacts,
      and to dynamically reference the project name in various places
      like repository and package metadata, license, citation, and other documentation files.

    default_description: |
      If not provided (recommended), the default value is the following Python template,
      which generates the project name from the repository name by replacing all hyphens with spaces.
      Note that this is a dynamic template, which means it is evaluated at runtime during synchronization.
      Therefore, changing the GitHub repository name will automatically change the project name as well.

      these must be manually defined under the [`component`](#ccc-license-component) key.
      All other standard components are automatically retrieved from the SPDX database

      By default, the license is also incorporated into several other project components: 
      - License files are added to all releases.
      - License identifiers are added to all package metadata.
      - Full license and copyright information are featured on the documentation website.

      These include [issue form](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms)
      templates used to automatically maintain issue ticket forms,
      and settings for the project's [issue template chooser]()https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser),
      which is automatically maintained via the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yaml` configuration file.
      
      # GitHub Issues Settings
      This directory contains templates and configurations used when an issue is opened in the repository.

      ## Templates
      The issues templates use the GitHub's [issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms)
      to create customizable web form fields. Each `.yml` file (other than `config.yml`) provides a template for
      a specific issue type. The issue forms use the YAML format, with a series of defined [top-level keys](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms#top-level-syntax)
      such as `name`, `description` and `labels`, and a [body syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema)
      to define the form fields.

      Any YAML file created in this directory using the specified syntax will be automatically added to the list of possible
      issue forms that users can select from when opening a new issue in the repository.


      ## Configurations
      The [config.yml](../../.meta/config/issues_template_chooser.yaml) file contains the configurations for the
      [template chooser](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser),
      i.e. the landing page of the repository's 'Issues' section.

      ### Options
      - `blank_issues_enabled`: A boolean value defining whether free-form issues can be opened by users.
      - `contact_links`: An array of dictionaries, defining additional external links for opening issues.
      These options will be displayed alongside the available templates in the 'Issues' section of the repository.

                Only active forms are included in the repository's available issue forms.
                This can be used to dynamically toggle available issue forms based on certain conditions.

                For example, in |{{ ccc.name }}|'s default configurations, there are three separate issue forms
                defined for reporting bugs in the package's API, GUI, and CLI. However, your package may only have
                some of these interfaces, in which case it makes sense to only show the corresponding issue forms
                when the corresponding interfaces are present. This is achieved by adding a condition to each form.
              type: boolean
              default: true
            commit:
              summary: ID of the [release commit](#ccc-commit-release) associated with the form.
              description: |
                Each form must be associated with a release commit.
                This is used to correlate each issue in the repository with a commit type.
                When a pull request from a development branch is merged into a release branch,
                |{{ ccc.name }}| first determines the corresponding issue of the branch from the branch name,
                and then ascertains the corresponding primary commit type from the issue's primary type label,
                in order to decide which actions to perform on the release branch.
                
                If two or more forms are assigned the same [primary type](#primary-type),
                they must each define a unique subtype.
                The subtype must match the key of one of the [subtype labels](../label/index.md#subtypes).
                |{{ ccc.name }}| automatically adds the corresponding subtype label
                to each issue that is created using the form,
                and uses that with conjunction with the primary type label
                to unambiguously identify the form that was used to create each issue in the repository.
                It also helps maintainers and users
                differentiate between issues with the same primary type.

                Optionally, a list of projects can be specified for each form,
                in which case each issue created using the issue form
                is automatically added to all specified projects.
                Each project must be specified in the format `PROJECT-OWNER/PROJECT-NUMBER`,
                where `PROJECT-OWNER` is the username or organization name of the project owner,
                and `PROJECT-NUMBER` is the number of the project in the project owner's repository.

                Note that for this to work, either your project's
                [auto-add workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/adding-items-automatically)
                must be enabled, or the person opening the issue must have write permissions for the specified projects.

                - [ RepoDynamics/3, AAriam/1 ]
              type: array

              description: |
                Optionally, a default title can be added to each form,
                which will automatically pre-populate the title field
                when a user creates a new issue using the form.
              examples:
                - "API Bug: "
              type: string
            body:

              description: |
                |{{ ccc.name }}| allows you to define post-processing instructions for each form,
                which are executed after an issue is created using the form.

                Issues that are created using GitHub's issue forms are visually not very appealing,
                since GitHub simply creates a new `<h3>` heading for each form element,
                and adds the user input underneath, without any formatting.
                Moreover, there may be some elements that are only meant for the submission step,
                and are not meant to be displayed in the issue body (e.g., checkboxes for agreeing with terms and conditions).
                Therefore, |{{ ccc.name }}| allows you to define a template for the issue body,
                which is used to reformat the issue body after the issue is created.
                The template must be defined as a string representing valid Markdown and/or HTML syntax,
                where the user input for each form element is referenced (similar to Python strings)
                using the syntax `{id}`, where `id` is the `id` of the corresponding form element.

          Different [pull request templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)
          can only be accessed via [query parameters](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/using-query-parameters-to-create-a-pull-request)
          . Otherwise, the main template directly under [./github] is used.
          
          For example, to use a template file named `my_custom_template.md`, add the following query string at the end of the
          URL: `?template=my_custom_template.md`. A full URL may e.g. look like this:
          `https://github.com/my-username/my-repo/compare/main...my-branch?template=my_custom_template.md`.
          
          - Pull request template filenames are not case-sensitive, and can have an extension such as `.md` or `.txt`.
          - The YAML syntax used for issue forms is not supported for pull requests templates.
          
          By default, the template defined at [./github/pull_request_template.md](./github/pull_request_template.md)
          is used when opening a pull request. To use the extra templates in this directory,
          the `template` [query parameter](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/using-query-parameters-to-create-a-pull-request)
          must be added to the URL of the pull request form, defining the name of the template to use.
          For example, to use a template file named `my_custom_template.md`, add the following query string at the end of the
          URL: `?template=my_custom_template.md`. A full URL may e.g. look like this:

          and definition of [discussion category forms](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/creating-discussion-category-forms)
          to customize the templates that are available for community members to use
          when they open new discussions in the repository.

          To define a form for an existing discussion category,
          add a key-value pair where the key is the slug of the category name
          in the repository. For example, to create a template for the "New Releases" category,
          use the key `new-releases`.

          :::{admonition} Manual Action Required
          :class: attention

          Defining forms here will automatically
          [create discussion category forms](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/creating-discussion-category-forms)
          in the `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/` directory of the repository.
          However, unlike issue forms, where adding a new template file in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
          automatically adds it to the list of available issues, discussion category forms only work when a
          corresponding discussion category is already created in the repository.
          Moreover, creating new discussion categories is not yet supported by the GitHub API.
          This means that for each new discussion category form defined here, you must manually
          [create the corresponding discussion category](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions#creating-a-category)
          in the repository. For example, if you define a form here under the key `new-releases`,
          you must also create a category named `New Releases`, or any other name that matches the slug.

                Each YAML file defines a form for a specific discussion category, indicated by the
                filename, which must correspond with the slug for one of the discussion categories.
                For example, the template for the "New Announcements" category should be stored in
                `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/new-announcements.yml`.
                
                To be recognized by GitHub, discussion category forms must be stored in the directory `/.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/`
                (i.e. this directory).

      These include general GitHub repository metadata
      such as description, topics (keywords), and homepage URL,
      as well as security configurations, merge strategies,
      and section toggles (e.g., Discussions, Projects, Wiki).
      Git settings include `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files.

      Some keys are automatically retrieved from GitHub's REST
      [API response](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-repository)
      during configuration synchronization and are always set to the source repository's metadata,
      meaning that even in forked repositories,
      these keys will always reflect the source repository's settings:
      `id`, `node_id`, `name`, `full_name`, `created_at`, `default_branch`, and `url`.

          :class: tip dropdown

          When working with a local clone of the repository on your computer,
          you can override these configurations 
          by creating a `.local_cc_config.yaml` file with the same syntax
          in the root of the repository.
          This file is automatically added to the `.gitignore` file
          and thus will not be tracked by Git 
          or pushed to the remote repository.
          This allows you to maintain a local caching configuration 
          without affecting the remote repository.

      From the seven [main directories](/manual/fundamentals/structure/index.md) in your repository
      that |{{ccc.name}}| manages and works with,
      the [GitHub directory](/manual/fundamentals/structure/github.md)
      and the [Docs directory](/manual/fundamentals/structure/docs.md)
      have fixed paths according to GitHub requirements,
      while the path to the other five directories can be customized.
      As discussed before,
      [Customizing the path to the control center directory](/manual/control/structure/index.md#location)
      requires a configuration file outside the control center directory.
      The path to the remaining four directories,
      i.e., the [source](/manual/fundamentals/structure/source.md),
      [tests](/manual/fundamentals/structure/tests.md),
      [website](/manual/fundamentals/structure/website.md), and
      [local](/manual/fundamentals/structure/local.md) directories,
      along with the paths to subdirectories of the local directory,
      can be customized using the `path.yaml` file
      in your repository's control center, as described in this section.

      All paths are relative to the root of the repository.

      The `local` key accepts an object with
      keys `root`, `cache`, and `report`. The `root` key must be set to a string defining
      the path to the local directory itself. The `cache` and `report` keys
      correspond to the cache and report subdirectories of the local directory;
      they accept an object with a key `root` that must be set to a string defining
      the path to the corresponding subdirectory, relative to the root of the local directory.
      In addition, they each define paths to other subdirectories of the corresponding cache/report subdirectory,
      each used for a specific tool. By default, the following keys are defined
      for both the `cache` and `report` subdirectories: `repodynamics`, `coverage`, `mypy`, `pylint`,
      `pytest`, and `ruff`. Each of these keys must be set to a string defining the path
      to the cache/report subdirectory for that tool,
      relative to the root of the corresponding cache/report subdirectory.

      You can also add other custom keys under `dir.local.cache` and `dir.local.report`
      for other tools that you use, and reference them in the corresponding configuration files.
      Note that you do not have to specify all keys in the `path.yaml` file;
      for all keys that are not specified, |{{ccc.name}}| will use the default values.
      Also, you can entirely omit the `path.yaml` file if you do not want to customize any paths.


      For example, if you only want to
      - change the path of the source directory to `my_source_directory`,
      - change the path of the cache subdirectory to `my_cache_directory`, and
      - add a new subdirectory `my_tool_subdirectory` under the report subdirectory
        for the tool `my_tool`,

      :::{admonition} Important Considerations
      :class: important

      - You must also manually create/rename/move the corresponding directories to match the set path,
        in the same commit where you create/modify/delete the `path.yaml` file.
      - All four main directories must be orthogonal to all other
        [main directories](/manual/fundamentals/structure/index.md) in your repository,
        meaning that they cannot be a subdirectory of any other main directory.
      :::

      |{{ccc.name}}| automatically manages a variety of files in your repository's main directories,
      and performs a number of tasks that require access to these files.
      For example, to run your tests and build your website, |{{ccc.name}}| needs to know
      the path to tests and website directories. In addition, these paths are used as
      substitutions in a number of other configuration files for your project,
      so that you do not have to manually update these files when you change a path.
      The following are just a few examples of configuration files where these paths are used:
