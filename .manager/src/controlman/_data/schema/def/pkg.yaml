  Configurations for a Python package.
  This corresponds to data for both the project's Python package and test suite.
  However, some fields (e.g., OS and Python version requirements)
  are only relevant for the package,
  and are automatically reused for the test suite,
  as they must be identical.
  
  :::{admonition} Usage
  :class: dropdown note
  Among others, these settings are used to automatically generate
  [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) compliant
  [`pyproject.toml`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml)
  files for the package and test suite, which contain all metadata and specifications
  required for building, packaging, and distributing them.

  name:
    description: |
      Name of the Python distribution package.

      For consistency, it is strongly recommended to
      **choose a project name that is most similar to a valid package name**,
      and leave the package name to be automatically generated.
      For example, you can name your project `My Project`,
      and the package name will be `My-Project`.

      ::::{admonition} PyPA Naming Rules
      :class: dropdown attention

      According to [Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/name-normalization/),
      the package name must consist only of ASCII alphanumeric characters,
      hyphens, underscores, and periods.
      Additionally, it must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
      PyPA then normalizes the package name by lowercasing the non-normalized name,
      and replacing all runs of consecutive hyphens, underscores, and periods with a single hyphen.

      :::{code-block} python
      :class: dropdown
      :caption: Name Normalization Function

      import re

      def normalize_package_name(non_normalized_package_name: str) -> str:
          """Normalize a package name according to PyPA specifications."""
          normalized_package_name = re.sub(
             r'[._-]+', '-', non_normalized_package_name.lower()
          )
          return normalized_package_name
      :::

      This means that, for example, all following names are equivalent and can be used interchangeably
      (although they are displayed as-is on PyPI):
      - `my-project` (normalized form)
      - `my_project`
      - `my.project`
      - `My--Project`
      - `mY-._.-ProjEcT`
      ::::
    default_description: |
      By default, the project name is converted to a valid non-normalized package name
      according to PyPA rules. This is done by replacing all characters that are not
      ASCII alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, or periods with a hyphen,
      and removing all leading and trailing hyphens.

      This is done by lowercasing the name,
      replacing all characters that are not ASCII alphanumeric or underscore with an underscore,
      and removing all leading digits.

              :class: dropdown tip
              
              It is [highly recommended](https://github.com/pypa/packaging.python.org/pull/1274)
              to only define a lower bound for the Python version,
              and to [avoid upper-capping](https://discuss.python.org/t/requires-python-upper-limits/12663/76?page=2).
              We recommend following the
              [NumPy Enhancement Proposal (NEP) 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)
              and always supporting three previous minor versions.

      See [Conda-Build documentation](# https://conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/resources/define-metadata.html).
      
      Conda packages are built with [conda-build](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/),
      using instructions that are mostly defined in a single YAML file named
      [meta.yaml](https://conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/resources/define-metadata.html).
      The YAML file can be created [from scratch](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html)
      , or with help of other utilities, such as [conda skeleton](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html)
      . After build, the package distribution can be
      [uploaded](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anacondaorg/user-guide/tasks/work-with-packages/#uploading-packages)
      on an Anaconda channel. While this may be done on a [personal channel](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/create-custom-channels.html)
      , this complicates the installation process for users as they now have to specify the channel as well.
      A more convenient alternative is to publish the package on the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) channel.
      This requires following the [instructions](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html).
