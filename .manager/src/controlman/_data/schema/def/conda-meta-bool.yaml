title: Conda Meta Boolean
description: |
  A boolean value in a conda recipe metadata file.
  
  Since values can be repeated with different selectors,
  this is an array. Note that if only one variant has a selector,
  then all entries must have a selector, and at most only one selector
  must evaluate to False at all times. Otherwise,
  two or more keys with the same name will remain in the metadata file,
  which will raise an error during build.
