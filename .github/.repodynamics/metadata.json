By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended\n      to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a\n      program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.\n    </ns0:p>\n    <ns0:p>\n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n      price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n      have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n      for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n      if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n      it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n    </ns0:p>\n    <ns0:p>\n      Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect\n      your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the\n      software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal\n      permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n    </ns0:p>\n    <ns0:p>\n      A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements\n      made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread\n      use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many\n      developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the\n      resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network\n      servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public\n      License permits making a modified version and letting the public access\n      it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.\n    </ns0:p>\n    <ns0:p>\n      The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically\n      to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes\n      available to the community. It requires the operator of a\n      network server to provide the source code of the modified version\n      running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use\n      of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives\n      the public access to the source code of the modified version.\n    </ns0:p>\n    <ns0:p>\n      An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published\n      by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different\n      license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new\n      version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.\n    </ns0:p>\n    <ns0:p>\n      The precise terms and conditions for copying,\n      distribution and modification follow.\n    </ns0:p>\n    <ns0:p>\n      TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n    </ns0:p>\n    <ns0:list>\n      <ns0:item>\n        <ns0:bullet>0.</ns0:bullet>\n        Definitions.\n        <ns0:p>\n          \"This License\" refers to version 3 of\n          the GNU Affero General Public License.\n        </ns0:p>\n        <ns0:p>\n          \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply\n          to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n        </ns0:p>\n        <ns0:p>\n          \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\n          this License.
