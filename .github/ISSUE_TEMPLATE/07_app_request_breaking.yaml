      Before submitting a report, please make sure that you are following our <a href=\"\
      https://repodynamics.github.io/PyPackIT/contribute\">Contributing Guidelines</a>
      to verify that: <ol>\n  <li>\n    Your request is in fact for a breaking change,
      and not a new feature or an enhancement.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The request has
      not yet been filed by another person.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n    💡 <a
      href=\"https://github.com/RepoDynamics/PyPackIT/discussions/new?category=question_issues\"\
      ><b>Open a discussion instead!</b></a>\n    <br>\n    This verification process
      is non-trivial, and can be time-consuming.\n    If you are not a collaborator
      and don't have the time to go through the process,\n    you can always open
      a discussion instead; we will investigate the problem as soon as possible,\n\
      \    and convert the discussion into an issue if the request is valid.\n</blockquote>\n
