      # Discussion Category Forms
      [Discussion category forms](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/creating-discussion-category-forms)
      customize the templates that are available for community members to use
      when they open new discussions in the repository.
      It encourages community members to include specific, structured information
      in their discussions by using customizable web form fields.

      To be recognized by GitHub, discussion category forms must be stored in the directory `/.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/`
      (i.e. this directory). Each YAML file defines a form for a specific discussion category, indicated by the
      filename, which must correspond with the slug for one of the discussion categories.
      For example, the template for the "New Announcements" category should be stored in `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/new-announcements.yml`.
      Discussion forms, like issue forms, are written in YAML, using the
      GitHub [form schema](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema).

    .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE: |
      # GitHub Issues Settings
      This directory contains templates and configurations used when an issue is opened in the repository.

      ## Templates
      The issues templates use the GitHub's [issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms)
      to create customizable web form fields. Each `.yml` file (other than `config.yml`) provides a template for
      a specific issue type. The issue forms use the YAML format, with a series of defined [top-level keys](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms#top-level-syntax)
      such as `name`, `description` and `labels`, and a [body syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema)
      to define the form fields.

      Any YAML file created in this directory using the specified syntax will be automatically added to the list of possible
      issue forms that users can select from when opening a new issue in the repository.


      ## Configurations
      The [config.yml](../../.meta/config/issues_template_chooser.yaml) file contains the configurations for the
      [template chooser](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser),
      i.e. the landing page of the repository's 'Issues' section.

      ### Options
      - `blank_issues_enabled`: A boolean value defining whether free-form issues can be opened by users.
      - `contact_links`: An array of dictionaries, defining additional external links for opening issues.
      These options will be displayed alongside the available templates in the 'Issues' section of the repository.

    .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE: |
      # GitHub Pull Requests Templates
      This directory contains additional templates for pull requests.

      By default, the template defined at [./github/pull_request_template.md](./github/pull_request_template.md)
      is used when opening a pull request. To use the extra templates in this directory,
      the `template` [query parameter](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/using-query-parameters-to-create-a-pull-request)
      must be added to the URL of the pull request form, defining the name of the template to use.
      For example, to use a template file named `my_custom_template.md`, add the following query string at the end of the
      URL: `?template=my_custom_template.md`. A full URL may e.g. look like this:
      https://github.com/my-username/my-repo/compare/main...my-branch?template=my_custom_template.md

      ## Notes
      - Pull request template filenames are not case-sensitive, and can have an extension such as `.md` or `.txt`.
      - The YAML syntax used for issue forms is not supported for pull requests templates.
