      # Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

      ## Our Pledge

      We, the members, contributors, maintainers, and creators of ***${{name}}***,
      pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
      diverse, inclusive, healthy, and harassment-free community for every person involved in this project.

      ## Our Standards

      Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
      community include:

      * Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
      * Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
      * Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
      * Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
        and learning from the experience.
      * Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
        overall community.

      Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

      * The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
        advances of any kind.
      * Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
      * Public or private harassment.
      * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
        address, without their explicit permission.
      * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
        professional setting.

      ## Enforcement Responsibilities

      Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
      acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
      response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
      or harmful.

      Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
      comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
      not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
      decisions when appropriate.

      ## Scope

      This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
      an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
      Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
      posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
      representative at an online or offline event.

      ## Enforcement

      Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
      reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement,
      at [${{maintainer.email.code_of_conduct}}](mailto:${{maintainer.email.code_of_conduct}}).
      All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

      All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
      reporter of any incident.

      ## Enforcement Guidelines

      Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
      the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

      ### 1. Correction

      **Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
      unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

      **Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
      clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
      behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

      ### 2. Warning

      **Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
      of actions.

      **Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
      interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
      those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
      includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
      like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
      permanent ban.

      ### 3. Temporary Ban

      **Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
      sustained inappropriate behavior.

      **Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
      communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
      private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
      with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
      Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

      ### 4. Permanent Ban

      **Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
      standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
      individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

      **Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
      the community.

      ---Provide necessary steps to mitigate the problem.---


      ### What to Include
      In order to help us triage and prioritize submissions, we recommend that your reports:
      * Describe the location the vulnerability was discovered,
      affected components/versions, and the potential impact of exploitation.
      * Offer a detailed description of the vulnerability and the steps needed to reproduce it
      (proof of concept scripts or screenshots can be helpful).
      * if known, necessary steps to mitigate the issue.

      For more information, see GitHub Documentations on [creating a repository security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory)
      and [best practices for writing repository security advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/best-practices-for-writing-repository-security-advisories).

      ### Response Policy
      When you choose to share your contact information with us,
      we commit to coordinating with you as openly and as quickly as possible:
      * Within a week, our vulnerability management team will acknowledge receiving your report.
      * To the best of our ability, we will confirm the existence of the vulnerability to you
      and be as transparent as possible about what steps we are taking during the remediation process,
      including on issues or challenges that may delay resolution.
      * We will maintain an open dialogue to discuss issues.

      ### Disclosure Policy
      This project follows a 90-day disclosure timeline.
      If you are a security researcher and would like to disclose the vulnerability you detected,
      we request that you allow us at least 90 days prior to any public exposure.
      This helps the project contributors to resolve the vulnerability and issue a new release,
      and provides our users a chance to update their applications and protect themselves.



      ## Testing for Vulnerabilities
      ${{name}} is a free and open-source project.
      We encourage security researchers to help us improve our security measures
      by conducting vulnerability discovery activities on our application, website, and repository.
      Before starting, please read the [guidelines](#testing-for-vulnerabilities) below,
      describing what systems and types of research are covered under this policy.

      ### Authorization
      If you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research,
      we will consider your research to be authorized, will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly,
      and will not recommend or pursue legal action related to your research.
      Should legal action be initiated by a third party against you for activities that were conducted
      in accordance with this policy, we will make this authorization known.

      ### Guidelines
      Under this policy, "research" and "vulnerability discovery" means activities in which you:
      * notify us as soon as possible after you discover a real or potential security issue,
      * make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience,
      disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data,
      * only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability's presence,
      * do not use an exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish persistent command line access,
      or use the exploit to pivot to other systems,
      * provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly,
      * do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.

      Once you've established that a vulnerability exists or encounter
      any sensitive data (including personally identifiable information, financial information,
      or proprietary information or secrets of any kind), you must:
      * stop your test,
      * notify us immediately,
      * and not disclose this data to anyone else.

      ### Test Methods
      The following test methods are not authorized:
      * Network denial of service (DoS or DDoS) tests or other tests that
      impair access to or damage a system or data.
      * Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing), or any other non-technical vulnerability testing.

      ### Scope
      This policy applies to the following systems and services:
      * Source code at ${{url.github.home}}

      Any service not expressly listed above, such as any connected services, are excluded from scope
      and are not authorized for testing. Additionally, vulnerabilities found in systems from our vendors
      fall outside of this policy's scope and should be reported directly to the vendor according to their
      disclosure policy (if any). If you aren't sure whether a system is in scope or not,
      or there is a particular system not in scope that you think merits testing,
      please contact us at ${{maintainer.email.security}} to discuss it first, before starting your research.
