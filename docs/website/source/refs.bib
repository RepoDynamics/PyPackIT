This report presents some of the results from the meeting and recommends promising areas for further work. It describes the need for PSEs, lists characteristics that many PSEs share and lists a few current systems. Design goals and future directions, with an emphasis on research issues, are outlined, followed by summary findings and conclusions.",

abstract = {Recent developments of computational methods supporting scientific research have led to the rise of a variety of computational science disciplines, such as computational physics, computational biology, computational chemistry, computational social science, and many more. Although simulation is now widely regarded as the third pillar of science, with epistemological status comparable to formal theorizing and experimentation, the insight that computational science is as interwoven with simulation as traditional science is with modeling, has not yet been sufficiently communicated. As a result, important insights from the modeling and simulation discipline are not known or are ignored by traditional scientists entering the computational branch of their discipline. This presentation contributes to closing this gap by giving examples of how modeling and simulated based research contributes to improve computational sciences, including having a look at the supporting philosophy of science perspectives.},

abstract="We discuss the two classic approaches (pillars) to acquire new insight in science: experiment and theory. As computer simulations supersede the classic experiment and blackboard theory, we obtain a third pillar. This notion of a third pillar can be challenged, but it motivates us to define new research areas assembled under the umbrella of the catchphrase computational science and engineering. After a quick sketch of the simulation pipeline---typical steps required in any computational discipline---we introduce scientific computing as area conducting research into the tools enabling insight through computing.",

              Science. They describe the data management life cycle for the
              data to be collected, processed and/or generated within the
              lifetime of a particular project or activity. A Software Manag
              ement Plan (SMP) plays the same role but for software. Beyond its
              management perspective, the main advantage of an SMP is that it
              both provides clear context to the software that is being
              developed and raises awareness. Although there are a few SMPs
              already available, most of them require significant technical
              knowledge to be effectively used. ELIXIR has developed a
              low-barrier SMP, specifically tailored for life science
              researchers, aligned to the FAIR Research Software principles.
              Starting from the Four Recommendations for Open Source Software,
              the ELIXIR SMP was iteratively refined by surveying the practices
              of the community and incorporating the received feedback.
              Currently available as a survey, future plans of the ELIXIR SMP
              include a human- and machine-readable version, that can be
              automatically queried and connected to relevant tools and metrics
              within the ELIXIR Tools ecosystem and beyond.",

abstract = {High-performance computing has recently seen a surge of interest in heterogeneous systems, with an emphasis on modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These devices offer tremendous potential for performance and efficiency in important large-scale applications of computational science. However, exploiting this potential can be challenging, as one must adapt to the specialized and rapidly evolving computing environment currently exhibited by GPUs. One way of addressing this challenge is to embrace better techniques and develop tools tailored to their needs. This article presents one simple technique, GPU run-time code generation (RTCG), along with PyCUDA and PyOpenCL, two open-source toolkits that supports this technique. In introducing PyCUDA and PyOpenCL, this article proposes the combination of a dynamic, high-level scripting language with the massive performance of a GPU as a compelling two-tiered computing platform, potentially offering significant performance and productivity advantages over conventional single-tier, static systems. The concept of RTCG is simple and easily implemented using existing, robust infrastructure. Nonetheless it is powerful enough to support (and encourage) the creation of custom application-specific tools by its users. The premise of the paper is illustrated by a wide range of examples where the technique has been applied with considerable success.}

Python, a free, cross-platform, general-purpose, high-level programming language, has seen widespread adoption among the scientific community, resulting in the availability of a large number of software packages, from numerical computation (NumPy, SciPy) and machine learning (scikit-learn) to visualization and plotting (matplotlib). SunPy is a data-analysis environment specializing in providing the software necessary to analyse solar and heliospheric data in Python. SunPy is open-source software (BSD licence) and has an open and transparent development workflow that anyone can contribute to. SunPy provides access to solar data through integration with the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), and the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) webservices. It currently supports image data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and IRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and PROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from e-Callisto and STEREO/SWAVES. We describe SunPyʼs functionality, provide examples of solar data analysis in SunPy, and show how Python-based solar data-analysis can leverage the many existing tools already available in Python. We discuss the future goals of the project and encourage interested users to become involved in the planning and development of SunPy.}

abstract = {Abstract MDAnalysis is an object-oriented library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. It is written in the Python language with some performance-critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose trajectory data as fast and efficient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis. MDAnalysis has been tested on and works for most Unix-based platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X.

Starting with the simple syntax of Python, Numba compiles a subset of the language into efficient machine code that is comparable in performance to a traditional compiled language.

journal = {Computational Science \& Discovery},
abstract = {Pythran is an open source static compiler that turns modules written in a subset of Python language into native ones. Assuming that scientific modules do not rely much on the dynamic features of the language, it trades them for powerful, possibly inter-procedural, optimizations. These optimizations include detection of pure functions, temporary allocation removal, constant folding, Numpy ufunc fusion and parallelization, explicit thread-level parallelism through OpenMP annotations, false variable polymorphism pruning, and automatic vector instruction generation such as AVX or SSE. In addition to these compilation steps, Pythran provides a C++ runtime library that leverages the C++ STL to provide generic containers, and the Numeric Template Toolbox for Numpy support. It takes advantage of modern C++11 features such as variadic templates, type inference, move semantics and perfect forwarding, as well as classical idioms such as expression templates. Unlike the Cython approach, Pythran input code remains compatible with the Python interpreter. Output code is generally as efficient as the annotated Cython equivalent, if not more, but without the backward compatibility loss.}

  abstract  = {
        Despite the increasing importance of in silico experiments to the scientific discovery process,
        state-of-the-art software engineering practices are rarely adopted in computational science.
        To understand the underlying causes for this situation and to identify ways to improve it,
        we conducted a literature survey on software engineering practices in computational science.
        We identified 13 recurring key characteristics of scientific software development that are
        the result of the nature of scientific challenges, the limitations of computers,
        and the cultural environment of scientific software development.
        Our findings allow us to point out shortcomings of existing approaches
        for bridging the gap between software engineering and computational science
        and to provide an outlook on promising research directions that could
        contribute to improving the current situation.

abstract = {Science is driven by data. New technologies have vastly increased the ease of data collection and consequently the amount of data collected, while also enabling data to be independently mined and reanalyzed by others. And society now relies on scientific data of diverse kinds; for example, in responding to disease outbreaks, managing resources, responding to climate change, and improving transportation. It is obvious that making data widely available is an essential element of scientific research. The scientific community strives to meet its basic responsibilities toward transparency, standardization, and data archiving. Yet, as pointed out in a special section of this issue (pp. 692–729), scientists are struggling with the huge amount, complexity, and variety of the data that are now being produced.}

abstract = {It has been suggested that the data from bug repositories is not always in sync or complete compared to the logs detailing the actions of developers on source code.In this paper, we trace two sources of information relative to software bugs: the change logs of the actions of developers and the issues reported as bugs. The aim is to identify and quantify the discrepancies between the two sources in recording and storing the developer logs relative to bugs.Focussing on the databases produced by two mining software repository tools, CVSAnalY and Bicho, we use part of the SZZ algorithm to identify bugs and to compare how the "defects-fixing changes" are recorded in the two databases. We use a working example to show how to do so.The results indicate that there is a significant amount of information, not in sync when tracing bugs in the two databases. We, therefore, propose an automatic approach to re-align the two databases, so that the collected information is mirrored and in sync.},

abstract = {Empirical studies of software defects rely on links between bug databases and program code repositories. This linkage is typically based on bug-fixes identified in developer-entered commit logs. Unfortunately, developers do not always report which commits perform bug-fixes. Prior work suggests that such links can be a biased sample of the entire population of fixed bugs. The validity of statistical hypotheses-testing based on linked data could well be affected by bias. Given the wide use of linked defect data, it is vital to gauge the nature and extent of the bias, and try to develop testable theories and models of the bias. To do this, we must establish ground truth: manually analyze a complete version history corpus, and nail down those commits that fix defects, and those that do not. This is a diffcult task, requiring an expert to compare versions, analyze changes, find related bugs in the bug database, reverse-engineer missing links, and finally record their work for use later. This effort must be repeated for hundreds of commits to obtain a useful sample of reported and unreported bug-fix commits. We make several contributions. First, we present Linkster, a tool to facilitate link reverse-engineering. Second, we evaluate this tool, engaging a core developer of the Apache HTTP web server project to exhaustively annotate 493 commits that occurred during a six week period. Finally, we analyze this comprehensive data set, showing that there are serious and consequential problems in the data.},

We conducted a survey among ECLIPSE developers to determine the information in reports that they widely used and the problems frequently encountered. Our results show that steps to reproduce and stack traces are most sought after by developers, while inaccurate steps to reproduce and incomplete information pose the largest hurdles. Surprisingly, developers are indifferent to bug duplicates. Such insight is useful to design new bug tracking tools that guide reporters at providing more helpful information. We also present a prototype of a quality-meter tool that measures the quality of bug reports by scanning its content.},

               are hardly rewarded, as scientific output is typically measured

               scientific software is often developed without proper

               Ready-to-use project skeletons can be employed to accelerate the

abstract = {GitHub Issues is a widely used issue tracking tool in open-source software projects. Originally designed with broad flexibility, its lack of standardization led to incomplete issue reports, impeding software development and maintenance efficiency. To counteract this, GitHub introduced issue templates in 2016, which rapidly became popular. Our study assesses the current use and evolution of these templates in large-scale open-source projects and their impact on issue tracking metrics, including resolution time, number of reopens, and number of issue comments. Employing a comprehensive analysis of 350 templates from 100 projects, we also evaluated over 1.9 million issues for template conformity and impact. Additionally, we solicited insights from open-source software maintainers through a survey. Our findings highlight issue templates’ extensive usage in 99 of the 100 surveyed projects, with a growing preference for YAML-based templates, a more structured template variant. Projects with a template exhibited markedly reduced resolution time (381.02 days to 103.18 days) and reduced issue comment count (4.95 to 4.32) compared to those without. The use of YAML-based templates further significantly decreased resolution time, the number of reopenings, and the discussion extent. Thus, our research underscores issue templates’ positive impact on large-scale open-source projects, offering recommendations for improved effectiveness.},

abstract="Collaboration is a central activity in software engineering, as all but the most trivial projects involve multiple engineers working together. Hence, understanding software engineering collaboration is important for both engineers and researchers. This chapter presents a framework for understanding software engineering collaboration, focused on three key insights: (1) software engineering collaboration is model-based, centered on the creation and negotiation of shared meaning within the project artifacts that contain the models that describe the final working system; (2) software project management is a cross-cutting concern that creates the organizational structures under which collaboration is fostered (or dampened); and (3) global software engineering introduces many forms of distance -- spatial, temporal, socio-cultural -- into existing pathways of collaboration. Analysis of future trends highlight several ways engineers will be able to improve project collaboration, specifically, software development environments will shift to being totally Web-based, thereby opening the potential for social network site integration, greater participation by end-users in project development, and greater ease in global software engineering. Just as collaboration is inherent in software engineering, so are the fundamental tensions inherent in fostering collaboration; the chapter ends with these.",

abstract = {Most programs today are written not by professional software developers, but by people with expertise in other domains working towards goals for which they need computational support. For example, a teacher might write a grading spreadsheet to save time grading, or an interaction designer might use an interface builder to test some user interface design ideas. Although these end-user programmers may not have the same goals as professional developers, they do face many of the same software engineering challenges, including understanding their requirements, as well as making decisions about design, reuse, integration, testing, and debugging. This article summarizes and classifies research on these activities, defining the area of End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) and related terminology. The article then discusses empirical research about end-user software engineering activities and the technologies designed to support them. The article also addresses several crosscutting issues in the design of EUSE tools, including the roles of risk, reward, and domain complexity, and self-efficacy in the design of EUSE tools and the potential of educating users about software engineering principles.},

abstract = {Open source software is commonly portrayed as a meritocracy, where decisions are based solely on their technical merit. However, literature on open source suggests a complex social structure underlying the meritocracy. Social work environments such as GitHub make the relationships between users and between users and work artifacts transparent. This transparency enables developers to better use information such as technical value and social connections when making work decisions. We present a study on open source software contribution in GitHub that focuses on the task of evaluating pull requests, which are one of the primary methods for contributing code in GitHub. We analyzed the association of various technical and social measures with the likelihood of contribution acceptance. We found that project managers made use of information signaling both good technical contribution practices for a pull request and the strength of the social connection between the submitter and project manager when evaluating pull requests. Pull requests with many comments were much less likely to be accepted, moderated by the submitter's prior interaction in the project. Well-established projects were more conservative in accepting pull requests. These findings provide evidence that developers use both technical and social information when evaluating potential contributions to open source software projects.},

There is a potential for this transparency to radically improve collaboration and learning in complex knowledge-based activities. Based on a series of in-depth interviews with central and peripheral GitHub users, we examined the value of transparency for large-scale distributed collaborations and communities of practice. We find that people make a surprisingly rich set of social inferences from the networked activity information in GitHub, such as inferring someone else's technical goals and vision when they edit code, or guessing which of several similar projects has the best chance of thriving in the long term. Users combine these inferences into effective strategies for coordinating work, advancing technical skills and managing their reputation.},

abstract = {The advent of distributed version control systems has led to the development of a new paradigm for distributed software development; instead of pushing changes to a central repository, developers pull them from other repositories and merge them locally. Various code hosting sites, notably Github, have tapped on the opportunity to facilitate pull-based development by offering workflow support tools, such as code reviewing systems and integrated issue trackers. In this work, we explore how pull-based software development works, first on the GHTorrent corpus and then on a carefully selected sample of 291 projects. We find that the pull request model offers fast turnaround, increased opportunities for community engagement and decreased time to incorporate contributions. We show that a relatively small number of factors affect both the decision to merge a pull request and the time to process it. We also examine the reasons for pull request rejection and find that technical ones are only a small minority.},

    abstract = {Functional, usable, and maintainable open-source software is increasingly essential to scientific research, but there is a large variation in formal training for software development and maintainability. Here, we propose 10 “rules” centered on 2 best practice components: clean code and testing. These 2 areas are relatively straightforward and provide substantial utility relative to the learning investment. Adopting clean code practices helps to standardize and organize software code in order to enhance readability and reduce cognitive load for both the initial developer and subsequent contributors; this allows developers to concentrate on core functionality and reduce errors. Clean coding styles make software code more amenable to testing, including unit tests that work best with modular and consistent software code. Unit tests interrogate specific and isolated coding behavior to reduce coding errors and ensure intended functionality, especially as code increases in complexity; unit tests also implicitly provide example usages of code. Other forms of testing are geared to discover erroneous behavior arising from unexpected inputs or emerging from the interaction of complex codebases. Although conforming to coding styles and designing tests can add time to the software development project in the short term, these foundational tools can help to improve the correctness, quality, usability, and maintainability of open-source scientific software code. They also advance the principal point of scientific research: producing accurate results in a reproducible way. In addition to suggesting several tips for getting started with clean code and testing practices, we recommend numerous tools for the popular open-source scientific software languages Python, R, and Julia.},

abstract="Large-scale software development has become a highly collaborative and geographically distributed endeavor, especially in open-source software development ecosystems and their associated developer communities. It has given rise to modern development processes (e.g., pull-based development) that involve a wide range of activities such as issue and bug handling, code reviewing, coding, testing, and deployment. These often very effort-intensive activities are supported by a wide variety of tools such as version control systems, bug and issue trackers, code reviewing systems, code quality analysis tools, test automation, dependency management, and vulnerability detection tools. To reduce the complexity of the collaborative development process, many of the repetitive human activities that are part of the development workflow are being automated by CI/CD tools that help to increase the productivity and quality of software projects. Social coding platforms aim to integrate all this tooling and workflow automation in a single encompassing environment. These social coding platforms gave rise to the emergence of development bots, facilitating the integration with external CI/CD tools and enabling the automation of many other development-related tasks. GitHub, the most popular social coding platform, has introduced GitHub Actions to automate workflows in its hosted software development repositories since November 2019. This chapter explores the ecosystems of development bots and GitHub Actions and their interconnection. It provides an extensive survey of the state of the art in this domain, discusses the opportunities and threats that these ecosystems entail, and reports on the challenges and future perspectives for researchers as well as software practitioners.",

abstract = {Branching plays a major role in the development process of large software. Branches provide isolation so that multiple pieces of the software system can be modified in parallel without affecting each other during times of instability. However, branching has its own issues. The need to move code across branches introduces addition-al overhead and branch use can lead to integration failures due to conflicts or unseen dependencies. Although branches are used ex-tensively in commercial and open source development projects, the effects that different branch strategies have on software quality are not yet well understood. In this paper, we present the first empirical study that evaluates and quantifies the relationship between soft-ware quality and various aspects of the branch structure used in a software project. We examine Windows Vista and Windows 7 and compare components that have different branch characteristics to quantify differences in quality. We also examine the effectiveness of two branching strategies -- branching according to the software architecture versus branching according to organizational structure. We find that, indeed, branching does have an effect on software quality and that misalignment of branching structure and organiza-tional structure is associated with higher post-release failure rates.},
