## Personalized Links

To improve the documentation, all links referencing different parts
of your repository can be dynamically updated to point to the actual resources in your project's repository.
To enable this, click on the <button class="user-login-button btn btn-sm inline_icon pst-js-only" title="Login" aria-label="Login">
  <i class="fa-solid fa-user-gear fa-lg"></i>
</button> icon and enter your GitHub repository's address.
|{{ ccc.name }}| will save this data as a cookie on your browser,
and will reload it on next visits.

Note that the login icon is also available in the website's navigation bar,
which on large screens is located at the top-right corner of every page,
and in the top-left menu on small screens.
