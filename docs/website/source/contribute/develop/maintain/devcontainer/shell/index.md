# Shell Configuration Files

Shell configuration files are an essential component of Unix-like operating systems, acting as the foundation for controlling shell behavior, environment variables, command aliases, prompt appearance, function definitions, and more. They are scripts sourced automatically by the shell when it starts to customize user environments. For developers and system administrators, a deep understanding of how these files operate and how they interact is crucial for creating reliable, portable, and maintainable environments.

This guide is focused on `bash` and `zsh`, two of the most common interactive shells. It explores the differences between shell types, the specific configuration files involved, the order in which they're executed, and how to use them effectively.


## Shell Invocation Types

Shell configuration behavior depends on the type of shell sessions. There are two axes:

- **Login vs. Non-login**
- **Interactive vs. Non-interactive**

| Type                  | Description                                                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Login**             | Initiated by logging in via tty, ssh, or using `bash -l`          |
| **Non-login**         | Invoked by terminal emulators (e.g., `gnome-terminal`, `iTerm`)   |
| **Interactive**       | Connected to a user terminal and reads user input                 |
| **Non-interactive**   | Used for scripting or automation (e.g., cron jobs, CI pipelines)  |

A shell can be any combination of these: for example, `interactive + login` or `non-interactive + non-login`.

## Configuration File Overview

### Bash

| File               | Purpose                                             | Loaded in...                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `/etc/profile`     | System-wide defaults for login shells              | Login                         |
| `~/.bash_profile`  | User-specific login shell configuration            | Login                         |
| `~/.bash_login`    | Fallback if `~/.bash_profile` is missing           | Login                         |
| `~/.profile`       | POSIX-compatible login config                      | Login (if above are missing)  |
| `~/.bashrc`        | Interactive shell behavior                         | Non-login interactive         |
| `/etc/bash.bashrc` | System-wide equivalent to `~/.bashrc`             | Non-login interactive         |
| `~/.bash_logout`   | Commands to run at logout                          | Logout                        |

> **Important**: If `~/.bash_profile` exists, `~/.profile` is ignored. It's common to source `~/.bashrc` from `~/.bash_profile` to unify behavior.

### Zsh

| File           | Purpose                                       | Loaded in...                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `/etc/zshenv`  | Minimal system-wide defaults                  | All shells                        |
| `~/.zshenv`    | User-defined early environment setup          | All shells                        |
| `/etc/zprofile`| System-wide login shell config                | Login                             |
| `~/.zprofile`  | User-defined login shell config               | Login                             |
| `/etc/zshrc`   | System-wide interactive shell behavior        | Interactive                       |
| `~/.zshrc`     | User-defined interactive shell behavior       | Interactive                       |
| `/etc/zlogout` | System-wide logout config                     | Login shell logout                |
| `~/.zlogout`   | User logout customization                     | Login shell logout                |

## Execution Order

### Bash

- **Interactive login**: `/etc/profile` → `~/.bash_profile` → `~/.bashrc` (if manually sourced)
- **Interactive non-login**: `~/.bashrc`
- **Non-interactive**: None (unless explicitly sourced)

### Zsh

- **All shells**: `/etc/zshenv` → `~/.zshenv`
- **Login**: `/etc/zprofile` → `~/.zprofile`
- **Interactive**: `/etc/zshrc` → `~/.zshrc`
- **Logout**: `/etc/zlogout` → `~/.zlogout`

## Best Practices for Shell Configuration

### Unifying Login and Non-login Behavior

To avoid duplicated logic between `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.bashrc`, explicitly source `~/.bashrc` from the login file:

```bash
# ~/.bash_profile
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
  . ~/.bashrc
fi
```

This ensures that login shells benefit from the same aliases, functions, and environment variables as non-login shells.

### Avoid Polluting Non-interactive Environments

Many scripts and CI tools invoke shells in non-interactive mode. Adding interactive-specific behavior (e.g., setting `PS1`, printing messages) to these environments can break automation. Guard such logic:

```bash
case $- in
  *i*) ;;
  *) return;;
esac
```

### Modularize Your Configuration

Instead of placing all logic in a monolithic `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, split configuration into maintainable files:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
for file in ~/.config/shell/rc.d/*.sh; do
  [ -r "$file" ] && . "$file"
done
```

```
~/.config/shell/rc.d/
├── env.sh
├── aliases.sh
├── functions.sh
└── prompt.sh
```

This allows for cleaner version control, testing, and reusability across machines.

### Supporting Non-interactive Scripts

If scripts need a consistent environment, avoid sourcing full interactive configs. Instead, create a minimal `env.sh`:

```bash
# ~/.config/shell/env.sh
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
export EDITOR=nvim
```

Then, in scripts:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
. "$HOME/.config/shell/env.sh"
```

### Shell Debugging

To trace configuration loading:

```bash
bash --login -x
zsh -x
```

Or use embedded debug statements:

```bash
echo "Sourcing ~/.bashrc" >> ~/shell.log
```

### Version Control with Dotfile Managers

Use tools like [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/), [yadm](https://yadm.io/), or bare Git repos to manage your dotfiles. Always include a local override:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
[ -f ~/.bashrc.local ] && . ~/.bashrc.local
```

This keeps secrets or machine-specific changes out of version control.

## Summary

- Shell behavior depends on whether it's login, non-login, interactive, or non-interactive.
- Bash and Zsh load different sets of configuration files depending on context.
- Always guard interactive-only logic with checks.
- Modularize configuration files for clarity and maintainability.
- Avoid sourcing full configs in scripts—use minimal setups instead.

By following these practices, you can build a reliable, portable, and developer-friendly shell environment that's easy to maintain and debug across systems and contexts.
