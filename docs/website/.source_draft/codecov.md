[Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) is an online platform
that provides code coverage metrics for your project.
After [signing up on Codecov](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/quick-start),
these configurations will automatically control the generation of coverage reports
and the submission of these reports to Codecov.
