# Peer Review

## pyOpenSci

[pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/) offers
[peer review](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/index.html) of Python software,
which comes with several [benefits](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/about/benefits.html),
including a [fast-tracked publication to JOSS](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/partners/joss.html).

pyOpenSci's [Peer Review Guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/index.html)
outlines the [scope](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/about/package-scope.html)
of supported packages and contains
[step-by-step instructions](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/our-process/review-timeline.html)
for submitting a peer-review request,
which involves [submitting an issue](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission/issues/new/choose)
to their [issue tracking system](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission/issues) on GitHub.
For an overview of all relevant information,
see their [Author Guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/how-to/author-guide.html).


## OpenSSF Best Practices Badge

The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices badge is
a way for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to show that they follow best practices.
Projects can voluntarily self-certify, at no cost, by using [this web application](https://www.bestpractices.dev)
to explain how they follow each best practice.
The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge is inspired by the many badges available to projects on GitHub.
Consumers of the badge can quickly assess which FLOSS projects are following best practices
and as a result are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software.
