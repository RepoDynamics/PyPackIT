#### [Scope](https://joss.theoj.org/about#submitting)
JOSS publishes articles about research software.
This definition includes software that:
solves complex modeling problems in a scientific context (physics, mathematics, biology, medicine, social science, neuroscience, engineering);
supports the functioning of research instruments or the execution of research experiments; extracts knowledge from large data sets;
offers a mathematical library; or similar.

JOSS submissions must:
- Be open source (i.e., have an OSI-approved license).
- Have an obvious research application.
- Be feature-complete (no half-baked solutions) and be designed for maintainable extension (not one-off modifications).
- Minor 'utility' packages, including 'thin' API clients, and single-function packages are not acceptable.
