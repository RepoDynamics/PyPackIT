      When filters are specified, document components are
      included in the output only if
      - they have no conditions defined, or
      - at least one of the defined conditions matches one of the filters.

      :::{admonition} Usage
      :class: dropdown note toggle-shown

      Filters can be used to dynamically generate similar versions
      of a document from the same source. For example,
      you may want to output both a short version and a long version for a document.
      To do so, you can e.g., add "short" and "long" conditions to the respective
      document content. Then, for the long version, define no filters
      to include all content in the output. For the short version,
      add "short" as a filter, so that only components with a "short" condition are included.
