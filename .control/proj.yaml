highlights:
  - title: Ready to Use
    description: |
      ${{ name }}$ is fully preconfigured and readily installed
      in both new and existing repositories,
      requiring most users to only fill project-specific metadata.
      PyPackIT then takes over, automatically setting up the repository 
      and generating a complete infrastructure for the project 
      where the only remaining steps 
      software development process are adding your code, unit-tests and documentation content.
  - title: Customizability and Dynamism
    description: |
      While fully configured out of the box, ${{ name }}$ is highly customizable,
      allowing users to tailor every aspect of their project
      and development pipeline to their specific needs.
      ${{ name }}$'s control center provides detailed configuration options
      in a declarative format, while enabling the dynamic generation of custom specifications
      and metadata during runtime. All these can be used to generate and augment
      other files, rendering the entire project dynamic and eliminating redundancy.
  - title: Cloud Development
    description: |
      ${{ name }}$ is a cloud-based solution that integrates with GitHub
      and uses GitHub Actions to automate the software development process.
      It provides a cloud-native development environment that
      eliminates the need for initial setup and configuration, 
      enabling users to immediately begin the actual 
      implementation of software, even directly from the web browser.
      This promotes collaboration, which is essential for project sustainability.
  - title: Continuous Configuration Automation
    description: |
      ${{ name }}$ provides a centralized user interface
      based on **DevOps** practices like **Infrastructure-as-Code** (IaC)
      to enable **Continuous Configuration Automation** (CCA)
      for the entire project. ${{ name }}$'s control center
      simplifies project configuration, customization, and management
      via automatic data **templating** and **augmentation**, cross-repository **inheritance**,
      and **synchronization** features that instantly apply modifications to all project components.
  - title: Python Package
    description: |
      ${{ name }}$ includes a fully-configured and build-ready
      package skeleton automatically maintained via the control center. 
      Users only need to add application code in the provided source files,
      while PyPackIT automates all integration, packaging, and deployment tasks.
      To facilitate software findability and usage,
      each new release is published to GitHub, PyPI, and Zenodo,
      with a persistent DOI ensuring reproducibility and reliable citations.
  - title: Test Suite
    description: |
      ${{ name }}$'s fully operational testing infrastructure enables the 
      immediate adoption of test-driven methodologies,
      requiring users to only provide test cases in the provided skeleton. 
      Testing is then automatically performed throughout the development life-cycle,
      while improving awareness of software health status via notifications and reports. 
      The test suite is automatically packaged and distributed along each release, 
      allowing for verification of software functionality and performance by its users.
  - title: Documentation Website
