highlights:
  - title: Ready to Use
    description: |
      ${{ name }}$ is fully preconfigured and easily installable
      in both new and existing repositories via a GitHub repository template.
      Most users only need to invest a few minutes filling project-specific information
      in the provided configuration files.
      PyPackIT then takes over, setting up the repository
      and generating a complete infrastructure and fully automated development workflow for the project.
      This leaves users with only few tasks throughout the software development life cycle,
      such as adding application code, unit-tests, and minimal documentation content.
  - title: Cloud Native Development
    description: |
      ${{ name }}$ is a cloud-based solution that integrates with GitHub
      and uses GitHub Actions to automate the entire software development process.
      It provides a cloud-native development environment that
      eliminates the need for initial setup and configuration,
      enabling users to immediately begin with the actual
      implementation of software, even directly from the web browser.
      All integration, testing, and deployment tasks are automatically carried out on the cloud,
      facilitating Agile development and ensuring the consistent enforcement of best practices.
  - title: Continuous Configuration Automation
    description: |
      ${{ name }}$ offers a centralized user interface
      for automatic configuration, customization, and management
      of the entire project, and even multiple projects at once.
      Based on DevOps practices like Infrastructure-as-Code,
      ${{ name }}$'s control center consolidates all project configurations
      into a unified data structure, supporting both declarative definitions
      and dynamic data generation at runtime via built-in templating, scripting,
      and online retrieval features.
      Configurations are automatically applied to related components,
      eliminating redundancy and rendering the entire project dynamic.
  - title: Continuous Integration & Deployment
    description: |
      ${{ name }}$'s CI/CD pipelines automate tasks such as code analysis,
      style formatting, type checking, refactoring, testing, dependency monitoring,
      versioning, build, containerization, release, and distribution,
      with support for multiple indexing repositories including PyPI, Anaconda,
      Zenodo, GitHub Releases, and all Docker registries.
      These Continuous software engineering pipelines eliminate the need for dedicated integration
      and deployment teams, while increasing control, integrity, scalability, security,
      and transparency of the Agile development process.
  - title: Continuous Refactoring & Testing
    description: |
      ${{ name }}$ provides Continuous pipelines that
      periodically perform automated testing, refactoring, and maintenance tasks
      such as testing previous releases with up-to-date dependencies,
      refactoring code according to the latest standards,
      upgrading development tools and project infrastructure,
      and cleaning up the repository and its development environment.
      ${{ name }}$ can automatically submit issue tickets and pull requests
      for applying updates and fixes, thus maintaining 
      the health of the project and ensuring its long-term sustainability.
  - title: Issue Management
    description: |
      ${{ name }}$ automatically maintains the project's issue tracking system,
      providing type-specific submission forms that are
      kept up-to-date with project information.
