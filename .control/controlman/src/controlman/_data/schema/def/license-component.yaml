      Path to the repository's [`LICENSE`](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository)
      file. To be [recognized by GitHub](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-26-easily-discover-and-navigate-to-multiple-licenses-in-repositories/),
      the license file must be named `OFL`, `PATENTS`, `LICENSE`, or `COPYING`,
      placed in the root of the repository.
      The latter two names can have a hyphenated suffix, e.g., `LICENSE-MIT` or `COPYING-AGPL-3.0`.
      The file can also have the extensions `.txt`, `.md`, or `.rst` (case-insensitive).
      However, only one period is allowed in the filename,
      i.e., if the suffix contains a period, the file cannot have an extension.
      Therefore, all input paths are automatically normalized
      by replacing all but the last period with a hyphen.

      to help PyPI better categorize your package,
      so that users can find your package when searching for packages with a specific license.
